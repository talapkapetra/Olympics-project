# Olympic Project

## Objective

I used a detailed dataset to compare the performances of Countries in Olympic Games in the time period: 1896-2012.

I mainly focused on the number of Medals awarded. 

I created data visualization in Tableau, I made two dashboards
- World: Contains all data worldwide.
- Hungary: I filtered dataset to Hungary.
