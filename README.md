# Olympics Data Analysis Project

## Data Source

I used [summer.csv]( https://talapkapetra.github.io/Olympics-project/summer.csv) which is a part of a dataset available on Kaggle.com.

This file contains Olympic sports, Athletes and medals awarded at summer Olympic games between 1986 and 2014.

## Objectives

My aim was to compare the performances of Countries in summer Olympic Games. I investigated acvhievements worldwide and in Hungary.

## Tools

Tableau, Tableau Public: data visualisation

## Data Visualisation in Tableau

I created an interactive visualisation of the data in Tableau with two dashboards: Word, Hungary

The dashboard contains interactive visualisations summarizing the medals awarded grouped by athletes, countries, regions, gender, disciplines.
